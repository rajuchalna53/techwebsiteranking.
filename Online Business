Here, to make it very easy for you to fee there fear you can think of your first day on the internet trying to buy something. What were the thoughts running through your mind, it will definitely help you.

Luckily, there are ways today by which you can prove yourself as a responsible and a sincere person; helping you in a long run.

Trust as I said is a lifeline of any business, but online we lack behind. At the retail stores you may have sure experienced that if any product does not lives up to your satisfaction, you can return it and in exchange you get a better one, if there is any price difference you get it cleared then and there itself. So, there is a transparency and in the end you build trust and are satisfied.

However, this is not the case here. We do not have this opportunity to build face to face trust which is the key in fact. People can’t see us and neither can we.

Now, here are few things that can take care of that initial trust.

Clear Your Intention

You will be at high risk while mentioning terms like paid reviews, as the reader will be under impression that you are favoring that product. It is understood that any company would pay a positive review which will add a feather in their hat.

It may sound weird that if you are writing a much favorable review the sales may go down. It sounds suspicious to the readers and will provoke them to check further options. Don’t you feel your review will appear like a TV commercial and will not be taken seriously.

The best thing here to do is to show the people advantages and the disadvantages of the product or service. Why is it good for a group of people and bad for some? Be clear with the description and help them choose the right product for their specific need. Like that they will like you more and rely on your feedback about any product. Also the kinds of customers a company will get are going to be genuine and happy. They will not feel cheated and all will be in win-win situation.

As a writer also you will establish yourself and achieve your goal being a reliable person. Customers derived by you towards any service or product will not be unsatisfied. Like this your clear intention will help not only the buyers, company but also you as an individual.


Policy of Honesty
It is good to share with the readers when they are turning profit for you or just by clicking on the link can be good for you because they may not like it doing so without their knowledge. Specially, at the initial level when everything is in doubts.

It is seen that only in a bracket (aff link) is added by the bloggers for the reader’s understanding that now they will be going on an affil’s site. It only tells them you are going to be profited if anything is bought. But, no terms are explained. It’s a fact that many of the readers are not even aware of what is meant by affil marketing.

You have an option of putting a disclaimer in the end or beginning of a page or post with a link to the actual explanation about the affiliates.


Disclose
Special or a specific location is not needed for disclosure, but if on your website there can be a one; will be good. In your about us page if you can put disclosure policy will be good. There is one more way rather you can keep a simple page with the explanations and link it to any post where you have utilized affiliate link to explain that:

You trust the services and only then link to them

You make profit on the things sold

The money you make here helps the blog

There are different types of customers everywhere, so there are some loyal readers also who want to thank you for what you do and will definitely help you clicking on the affiliate links. This is how honesty pays.


Share With them how they can be of Help to you
There is no harm adding one more page explaining readers how they can give their support. Don’t mention words like “support” as a link, it sounds like a donation demand.

This information will help people understand how a site is run and revenue is generated to pay for the site maintenance expenses when they buy any product online that you suggested.

You can also mention how you will earn a dollar if they download from the link given below. It is a kind of sharing information and spreading awareness.

Before creating such a page you yourself need to be sure of the rules and regulations first, because it is against the AdSense policy to provoke people to click on any link or ads.

If you explain the reader how they are contributing towards the growth of the online business, and what is their exact role here; they would certainly appreciate it and build trust that you are wanting to develop.
